# ApproxGNN: A Pretrained GNN for Parameter Prediction in Design Space Exploration for Approximate Computing

In this repository, we present the main parts of the algorithms and the neural network models needed for constructing the predictor. All sources are in the [model](model) folder.

Moreover, we will publish the pretrained models and training data, an example is in [data](data) folder.

This is a draft of the repository and will be updated upon acceptance.
